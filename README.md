This is ultrasonic pest repellent device for bugs based on ATTINY85, resistors and PAM4803 amplifier with set of transducers

Sinusoidal waveform taken from the program memory of ATTINY 85 chip is send to its PORT B output and then converted to analog signal using DAC with 2R RESISTOR LADDER ( see here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistor_ladder). 
The PAM4803 amplifies this 40kHZ sinusiodal wave to 2 x 3 Watt audio power wich gives 100dB of audio power nearby thge device.
